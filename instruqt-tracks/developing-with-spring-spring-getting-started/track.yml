title: Getting Started with Spring
description: |
  In this scenario, you will learn more about developer application using Spring Boot using [Red Hat Runtimes](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes).

  ## What you will learn
  You will learn how to get started with building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) web application.

  ## How is Spring Boot supported on OpenShift?

  Spring is one of the most popular Java Frameworks and offers an alternative to the Java EE programming model. Spring is also very popular for build application based on Microservices Architecture. Spring Boot is a popular tool in the Spring eco system that helps with organizing/using 3rd party libraries together with Spring and also provides a mechanism for boot strapping embeddable runtimes, like Apache Tomcat. Bootable applications (sometimes also called fat jars) fits the container model very well since in a container platform like OpenShift responsibilities like starting, stopping and monitoring applications are then handled by the container platform instead of an Application Server.

  Red Hat fully supports Spring and Spring Boot for usage on the OpenShift platform as part of Red Hat Runtimes. Red Hat also provides full support for Apache Tomcat, Hibernate and Apache CXF (for REST services) when used in a Spring Boot application on Red Hat Runtimes.
